Some people live for their work. Others work to try to live the life they want. This post is about understanding the difference between the two and knowing which phrase applies to how you live your life.

## Work to Live

The core definition of this phrase is: *I work so that I can live*. At it's best, this phrase is interpretted as I work so that I can live the life I want to live. At its most minimal, this phrase means I work so that I can live because I live in a society where I am forced to work in order to live what is accepted as a reasonable life.

These two interpretations define the spectrum across which Work to Live is practiced.

## Live to Work

The core definition of this phrase is: *I live for my work*. In other words, either because of a love of work or a life interpretation that demands that one works hard throughout his or her life, one who lives by this phrase prioritizes work over almost everything else in life. A person following this way of living to the extreme is a workaholic.

We've all known people who are so driven to work that it causes problems in other areas of that person's life. We've all heard of people who are equally driven to work because they have an intense passion for what they do but still manage to have a somewhat balanced life. Whether people like this are truly successful or not, it's almost guaranteed they have a work life balance that is heavily skewed toward work and it's pretty likely they don't devote the amount of time to family, interpersonal relationships and non-work activities that most of us would agree is balanced and healthy.

## Who am I?

At this point you probably have a pretty good understanding of which above philosophy you want to follow and which one you actually follow. I'm going to make the presumption that if you're reading this site, you're a lot more likely to follow the *work to live* philosophy. It's the philosophy I follow and I honestly believe that for the majority of people, it is healthier.

That is not to say *live to work* is unhealthy but it frequently can be. I personally know a lot more workaholics with unhealthy life/work balance issues than I know of Mother Teresas and Elon Musks (and even then it's pretty clear Elon Musk has a life/work imbalance most of us would not want).

## Why knowing matters

If you align with *work to live* then you work for a few primary reasons, listed in my order of priority:

+ to minimally survive as an individual (roof over head/stay safe, food to eat/health maintained)
+ to support others (family and others)
+ to pursue other interests
+ to build wealth

If you align with *live to work* you probably work for those same reasons with an additional one thrown in with pretty high priority and that is whatever reason drives you to work so hard (make lots of money, change/improve the world).

If you are *work to live* then knowing this matters because it tells you that every so often you need to check your priorities to guarantee that you are indeed devoting enough time and energy to the *live* part of that phrase. You need to recognize when you are not that you need to attempt to regain your balance.
